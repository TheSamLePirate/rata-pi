# V3 progress tracker

Paired with `PLAN_V3.md`. Per-sub-milestone checklist; rolling metrics at the bottom; deviations logged.

**Legend:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` deviated (see Deviations) · `[—]` dropped

Each sub-milestone ships as its own commit with subject `feat(v3.X): <summary>` after passing:
`cargo fmt` · `cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings` · `cargo test --locked --all-features --all-targets` · `cargo build --release`.

---

## V3.a — RPC reliability ✅

- [x] `RpcClient::call()` removes pending entry on `send()` failure
- [x] `RpcClient::call_timeout(cmd, Duration)` added; `call()` delegates with 10 s default
- [x] `bootstrap()` — each sub-call at 3 s
- [x] `refresh_stats()` — 1 s
- [x] Slash/modal RPC sites — 10 s (inherited via `call()` default)
- [x] `RpcError::Timeout` surfaced as non-fatal flash (refresh_stats site)
- [x] Offline flash in `dispatch_settings_action` (AutoCompact / AutoRetry)
- [x] Tests:
  - [x] pending map empty after send failure (`call_removes_pending_on_send_failure`)
  - [x] `call_timeout` returns `Timeout` when oneshot idle (`call_timeout_returns_timeout_when_idle`)
  - [x] offline toggle flashes and flips local state (`settings_toggle_offline_flashes_for_rpc_backed_flags`)

**Shipped as** `022e358`

## V3.b — Perf regressions ✅

- [x] `AppCaps` struct built once in `App::new()` — clipboard / history path / state dir / term_caps / pi binary / platform / package version
- [x] `build_settings_rows` reads static rows from `app.caps` (no re-probe per frame)
- [x] `History::default_path()` cheap static accessor; `/log` and `/settings` use it
- [x] `term_caps::detect()` cached on `App.caps.term`; `/env`, `/doctor`, `/settings` read it
- [x] `files::preview` — metadata-first size check + `BufReader::take(MAX_BYTES)` bounded read
- [!] `spawn_blocking` offload for `files::preview` — **deviated** (see Deviations §1)
- [x] `Transcript::mutation_epoch` + `VisualsCache::last_seen_epoch` — fingerprint walk skipped on no-change frames
- [x] Tests:
  - [x] AppCaps populated and matches direct probes (`app_caps_matches_direct_probes`)
  - [x] `build_settings_rows` reads from `app.caps` (`settings_rows_read_from_app_caps`)
  - [x] `files::preview` rejects over-cap file without reading (`preview_rejects_files_over_size_cap_without_reading`)
  - [x] `files::preview` clips to MAX_LINES (`preview_clips_to_max_lines`)
  - [x] Visuals cache early-outs when epoch unchanged (`visuals_cache_skips_walk_when_epoch_unchanged`)
  - [x] Visuals cache walks after mutation (`visuals_cache_walks_after_mutation`)

**Shipped as** `41bb7f8`

---

## V3.c — CI hardening ✅

- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `ubuntu-latest` added to test matrix
- [x] Clippy job — `args: --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed explicitly
- [x] `build-notify` job — `cargo build --locked --features notify` on Ubuntu (installs libdbus-1-dev)
- [x] `build-release` job — `cargo build --locked --release` smoke on Ubuntu
- [x] Local parity: all three commands pass locally (test matrix will confirm on push)

**Shipped as** `be61ab1`

---

## V3.d — Module split (medium) ✅

- [x] `src/app/modals/mod.rs` re-export hub
- [x] `src/app/modals/interview.rs` — key/draw/dispatch extracted (905 LoC)
- [x] `src/app/modals/settings.rs` — rows/actions/body/key/dispatch extracted (618 LoC)
- [x] `src/app/events.rs` — `on_event`, `apply_state`, bootstrap `import_messages` (390 LoC)
- [x] `src/app/input.rs` — `handle_key` + `handle_focus_key` + `on_mouse_click` + `handle_vim_normal` (446 LoC)
- [x] `src/app/helpers.rs` — `truncate_preview`, `args_preview`, `approx_tokens`, `extract_error_detail`, `on_off` (87 LoC)
- [x] Tests moved alongside (or stayed — reducer tests still in mod.rs under `#[cfg(test)]` re-imports). All 203 tests pass across the split.
- [!] `src/app/mod.rs` target ≤ 5 100 lines — **deviated**, ended at 6 132. See Deviations §2.

- [x] commit 1: modals/interview — `b7862c7`
- [x] commit 2: modals/settings — `e00d5f3`
- [x] commit 3: events — `4fb8645`
- [x] commit 4: input — `f32b4ad`
- [x] commit 5: helpers — `32e848a`

## V3.e — UX quick wins

- [ ] `/help` body refreshed (essentials + pointers to /shortcuts /settings)
- [ ] Tab / Shift+Tab bound in `settings_modal_key` (skip Headers)
- [ ] `FlashKind { Info, Success, Warn, Error }` introduced; `App::flash_*` helpers; ~40 call sites migrated
- [ ] Slash aliases in catalog — `/keys`, `/hotkeys`, `/prefs`, `/preferences` (picker filter honors aliases)
- [ ] Cycle-row arrow cleanup — RPC-backed cycles render only `▸`
- [ ] Modal close-key consistency — read-only viewers accept Esc+q; interactive modals Esc only
- [ ] Ctrl+Enter on composer = submit
- [ ] Narrow interview hint — width-aware fallback under 90 cols
- [ ] Tests:
  - [ ] Tab skips Headers in /settings
  - [ ] `flash_success` uses `theme.success` color
  - [ ] `/help` body contains the new essentials list
  - [ ] picker filter `ke` surfaces `/shortcuts` via alias
  - [ ] `q` closes `Modal::Help`, not `Modal::Settings`

## V3.f — Plan approval flow

### State model
- [ ] `PlanOrigin { Agent, User }` enum
- [ ] `ProposedPlan` struct
- [ ] `App.proposed_plan: Option<ProposedPlan>`
- [ ] `App.active_plan` (renamed from `App.plan`)
- [ ] Invariant: `wrap_with_plan` reads only `active_plan`

### Parsing
- [ ] `apply_plan_markers_on_agent_end(&AgentEnd)` parses from `agent_end.messages`
- [ ] Transcript tail kept as fallback

### Modal
- [ ] `Modal::PlanReview(PlanReviewState)` variant
- [ ] Review mode: `↑↓ j k Enter Esc a e d t`
- [ ] Edit mode: `↑↓ Enter/i a x/Del t Ctrl+S Esc`
- [ ] Draw body matches spec

### Lifecycle
- [ ] `PLAN_SET` on agent_end → proposal + review modal + info row + `flash_info("review proposed plan")`
- [ ] Accept → `active_plan` populated, YOLO kick-off if `auto_run`
- [ ] Deny → proposal cleared + info row + flash
- [ ] Edit → Accept → edited items become active
- [ ] `PLAN_ADD` on active plan → amendment proposal (review modal)
- [ ] User `/plan set` activates immediately (no review)
- [ ] `STEP_DONE` / `STEP_FAILED` ignored when only `proposed_plan` exists

### Marker visibility
- [ ] `plan::strip_ranges` added
- [ ] Plan markers stripped from transcript (parallel to interview strip)
- [ ] `/settings → Appearance → show raw markers` toggle (`ToggleAction::ShowRawMarkers`)
- [ ] `App.show_raw_markers: bool` (default false) — when true, strip passes skipped

### Tests (cover full acceptance matrix)
- [ ] PLAN_SET on agent_end → proposal, no activation
- [ ] `wrap_with_plan` unchanged while proposal exists
- [ ] Accept path
- [ ] Deny path
- [ ] Edit → delete + add + edit text → Accept path
- [ ] Parsing from `agent_end.messages` wins over transcript tail
- [ ] PLAN_ADD on active plan creates amendment
- [ ] STEP_DONE no-op with only proposal
- [ ] `/plan set` bypasses review
- [ ] Plan markers stripped by default; visible with toggle on

### Acceptance criteria (from `plan_approval_flow.md`)
- [ ] 1. Agent PLAN_SET does not immediately become active
- [ ] 2. Agent PLAN_SET opens review modal automatically
- [ ] 3. Accept/Deny/Edit available
- [ ] 4. No auto-run before acceptance
- [ ] 5. Only accepted plan affects `wrap_with_plan`
- [ ] 6. STEP_DONE/STEP_FAILED only on accepted active plans
- [ ] 7. Visible transcript feedback for all transitions
- [ ] 8. Parsing from `agent_end.messages`
- [ ] 9. Marker visibility policy consistent

- [ ] `Theme` struct gains `syntect_name: &'static str`
- [ ] README refreshed (what / how to run / features / pi dep / links)
- [ ] USER_GUIDE — Plan approval section added

## Deviations

*(If any task deviates from `PLAN_V3.md`, record it below with: sub-milestone · task · what changed · why. Blank section = on plan.)*

### 2. V3.d · mod.rs ended at 6 132 lines, not ≤ 5 100
**What changed.** The plan targeted `src/app/mod.rs` ≤ 5 100 after the medium split; final LoC is 6 132.

**Why.** Every function the plan enumerated was extracted: the two modals (interview, settings), the reducer (events), the global input layer (input), and the cross-cutting helpers. Total reduction 8 466 → 6 132 = **-2 334 lines / -27.6%**. The remaining ~1 000 excess sits in two places:
- Modal *body renderer* functions (`doctor_body`, `mcp_body`, `help_text`, `commands_text`, `models_text`, `thinking_text`, `history_text`, `forks_text`, `ext_*_text`, `plan_full_lines`, `plan_card`, `git_*_body`, `file_preview_lines`, `file_finder_text`) — ~700 LoC. Natural home is a new `modals/bodies.rs` or per-modal files extending the pattern from V3.d.1/.2.
- `handle_modal_key` (~500 LoC) — per-variant dispatch for every `Modal::*` kind. Logical home is `modals/mod.rs` once every modal has its own submodule.

Both are clean mechanical extractions — the scope grew beyond what the V3.d milestone's "medium split" framing said to do in one pass. Deferred rather than expand the milestone. Plan for V3.d.* follow-up OR a dedicated V3.d.6 when we revisit the split later in V3 or early V4.

### 1. V3.b · skipped `spawn_blocking` offload for `files::preview`
**What changed.** The plan called for `files::preview` to be offloaded via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`. It isn't.

**Why.** The read is now bounded to `MAX_BYTES` (8 KiB) by `BufReader::take` and guarded by a `metadata()` size check that rejects >50 MiB files before opening them. On any reasonable filesystem the actual I/O is <1 ms — well below the UI frame budget — whereas a `spawn_blocking` hop costs a scheduler trip plus a channel round-trip per selection change. The root cause (unbounded `std::fs::read`) is fixed; adding async machinery on top of an already-cheap operation would add overhead for zero user-visible benefit. The plan note "optionally offload" covered this.

---

## Notes

- The V3.d split is lift-and-shift only. Any behavior change caught during extraction pauses the split and gets fixed in a dedicated commit on a prior sub-milestone.
- V3.f is the longest milestone. Expect 3+ commits inside it — split into (1) state model + parser, (2) review modal draw/key, (3) edit mode, (4) amendment flow + marker strip, (5) tests. Each of those sub-commits should still be green.
- If a deferred item from a review turns out to be wrong or obsolete during exploration, mark it `[—]` and note the reason in Deviations — don't silently drop.
- Keep the reviews (`code_review.md`, `code_ux_review.md`, `plan_mode_review.md`, `plan_approval_flow.md`) in the tree — they're the source of truth for what V3 owes.
